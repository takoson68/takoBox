Controllers handle user input and orchestrate interactions between Models and Views.

Put page- or feature-specific controllers here, e.g. `HomeController.js`.

Suggested patterns:
- Keep DOM access in Views; call Views from Controllers.
- Keep business logic in Models; call Models from Controllers.
